# OPEN IDEAS

This repository collects a set of exploratory ideas I’ve developed during my undergraduate studies.

These sketches weren’t written with the goal of becoming formal papers—or even necessarily “useful”—but rather as a way to explore concepts that intrigued or bothered me. In the spirit of Robert Langlands' letter to André Weil:

“After I wrote it I realized there was hardly a statement in it of which I was certain. If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not—I am sure you have a waste basket handy.”
